# Auto README for Terraform

Tool to help you create templated READMEs that contain the actual information from your Terraform Module. Iterates through your module folder and pick up all information needed to make your README look good and provide helpful content.

**NOTE:** Early stage of development, anyway it can fetch the most basic (and most time consuming) information from your module to create a README.
